# DroneDeliverySimulator

**A 3D simulator featuring drone-based package delivery within a grid-based environment, supported by ground vehicles delivering to depots.**

DroneDeliverySimulator is a lightweight 3D simulation that operates on a 5×5 grid. The simulation models drone-based package delivery operations, where drones collaborate with ground vehicles to transport packages to depots efficiently.

## Features

- A modular 5×5 grid enabling navigation and pathing.  
-  Aerial drone transports packages to houses within the grid.  
-  Ground vehicles deliver packages to depot, coordinating with drone operations.  
-  Visual feedback for monitoring movements within the grid.
-  Potential for easy extension to support dynamic grid sizing, multiple drone types, or advanced routing logic.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Download required packages `npm i`**
3. **Run the server `npm run dev` or `vite`**
